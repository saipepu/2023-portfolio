### My name is PePu.

ðŸ’» I am a programmer. I donâ€™t just solve coding problems. I help people solving their problems with my coding skill.

ðŸ‘¾ Programming makes me become a good listener. Listening to my clients or my teammates talking about their paint pains helps me solve half of the problems without even trying.

ðŸŽ¯ Fact: I love retrospective meeting. Sharing and learning from each other about what problems did we face during the sprint and how did we manage to solve them can help creating a smarter and a more intuitive team.

<i>I was a top-5 finalist in Hackathailand 2023. I have experience working with a couple of start-up teams.</i>

- I am interested in Tech Start Up and always on my own projects.
- If you are interested in collaborating with me, hit me up at saipepu.mdy257@gmail.com

My strong points are Frontend Animation, Project Management and Interactive Design.
