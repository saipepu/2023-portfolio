          <p>The pain point is that preparing the excel sheet to grade the competing team is time consuming.</p>

          <p>Designing was a breeze, but the development journey had its potholes. </p>
          <p>The biggest challenge that almost caught us was the concurrency issues when judges tried scoring a team at the same time.</p>
          <p>
            Discovered the bug the night before the event with a deadline 7am in the morning. There were 2 choices: just sleep and explain the problem in the morning or sacrifice the sleep.
            Guess what, after restructuring the logic and the way we stored the data, the bug was fixed at 4am and I took a much-needed NAP!.
